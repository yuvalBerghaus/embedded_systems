<h1>Welcome to Space War!</h1>

To start the game, wait for 3 seconds until the Space Wars screen is displayed, and then press any key to continue.

The objective of the game is to control the blue-colored space ship with the movement of the board using the accelerometer, avoid the falling purple-colored obstacles, and shoot them down using the red-colored laser beam.

Each step of the frame takes 1 second, and the player's movement will not be delayed.

If an obstacle hits the space ship, the game is over. You can restart the game by pressing the S3 button.
<b>Space Ship (Blue)</b>: This is the player-controlled space ship. Use the accelerometer to move it around and avoid the obstacles.
