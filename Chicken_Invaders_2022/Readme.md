Welcome to Space War!

To start the game, wait for 3 seconds until the Space Wars screen is displayed, and then press any key to continue.

The objective of the game is to control the blue-colored space ship with the movement of the board using the accelerometer, avoid the falling purple-colored obstacles, and shoot them down using the red-colored laser beam.

Each step of the frame takes 1 second, and the player's movement will not be delayed.

If an obstacle hits the space ship, the game is over. You can restart the game by pressing the S1 button.

Here's a visual guide to help you understand the game better:
